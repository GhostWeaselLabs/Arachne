# Concepts

Purpose

Who this is for
- New contributors who want to understand the system at a high level
- Users evaluating whether Meridian fits their use case
- Maintainers writing or reviewing design decisions

How to use this section
- Start with About to get a concise overview
- Read Patterns to learn how we expect you to compose systems
- Review Observability to see how introspection is built in
- Use the Glossary to align on terminology

Contents
- About: High-level overview and goals of the project
- Patterns: Recommended architectural patterns and anti-patterns
- Observability: Logging, metrics, traces, and how to use them effectively
- Glossary: Shared vocabulary for concepts across the docs

Conventions
- Files and directories use lowercase-kebab-case
- Headings use sentence case; proper nouns retain their canonical capitalization
