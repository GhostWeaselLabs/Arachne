# Meridian Runtime Feature Request Template (Privacy‑First)
# Owner: GhostWeasel (Lead: doubletap-dave)
# Purpose: Propose improvements that align with Meridian Runtime's goals—composability, predictability, observability, and privacy.

## 1) Summary
<!-- 1–3 sentences describing the feature at a high level. What problem does it solve? Who benefits? -->

## 2) Motivation and Use Cases
<!-- Explain why this is important. Include concrete scenarios (sanitized; no payload contents). -->
- Primary use case(s):
- Pain points with current behavior:
- Expected outcome/value:

## 3) Proposed Behavior / API
<!-- Describe the intended behavior. Include example usage patterns or CLI flows. -->
- Runtime/Library API (conceptual):
  - Example types/functions/classes (names and purpose only)
- CLI (if applicable):
  - Subcommands, flags, and expected outputs
- Configuration (if applicable):
  - Keys, defaults, and validation rules

## 4) Scope and Non‑Goals
<!-- Clarify boundaries to avoid scope creep. -->
- In scope:
- Out of scope:

## 5) Alternatives Considered
<!-- Summarize other approaches, trade‑offs, and why they were not chosen. -->
- Alternative A:
  - Pros:
  - Cons:
- Alternative B:
  - Pros:
  - Cons:

## 6) Impact
<!-- Describe expected impact on users, DX, and runtime characteristics. -->
- Backward compatibility:
- Performance considerations:
- Observability implications (logs/metrics/traces):
- Privacy posture (no payloads in errors by default; redaction hooks):
- Operational complexity:

## 7) Milestone Fit
<!-- Where might this fit in the roadmap? Short/medium/long term? Reference post‑v1 roadmap themes if relevant. -->
- Suggested horizon (v1.x / v2.x / v3.x+):
- Related roadmap items or Decision Records (if any):

## 8) Acceptance Criteria (EARS‑style)
<!-- Use clear, testable statements. -->
- Ubiquitous: "The system shall …"
- Event‑driven: "When <event>, the system shall …"
- State‑driven: "While <state>, the system shall …"
- Unwanted: "If <failure>, the system shall …"

Example:
- The system shall provide a CLI subcommand `meridian-runtime diagnostics collect` that creates a redacted bundle by default.
- When a user runs the command, the CLI shall omit secrets and payload contents and include environment summaries.
- While running under minimal permissions, the CLI shall degrade gracefully and indicate missing non‑essential data.
- If redaction fails for any field, the system shall default to omission rather than inclusion.

## 9) Example (Conceptual, Sanitized)
<!-- Provide a short worked example of how a user would experience the feature. No real data or payload contents. -->
- User flow:
  1) …
  2) …
  3) …
- Expected structured logs (redacted values; stable keys):
  - `event="feature_event", component="...", status="success"`

## 10) Risks and Mitigations
<!-- Privacy, security, operational, and maintenance risks with proposed mitigations. -->
- Risk:
  - Mitigation:
- Risk:
  - Mitigation:

## 11) Testing and Documentation Plan
<!-- How will we validate and document this feature? -->
- Tests:
  - Unit:
  - Integration:
  - Regression/compatibility:
- Documentation:
  - README changes:
  - `docs/plan` or Decision Record:
  - Examples/recipes:

## 12) Dependencies and Compatibility
<!-- New libraries, optional adapters, or environment constraints. -->
- New dependencies (runtime vs dev):
- Compatibility with Python 3.11+:
- Adapter requirements (optional/plug‑in):

## 13) Open Questions
<!-- List unresolved questions to facilitate discussion. -->
- Q1:
- Q2:
