"""Integration test: producer -> block edge -> slow consumer.

Scenario:
- Producer emits CONTROL messages which are routed with Block policy by the Scheduler.
- Edge capacity is small (e.g., 2), and consumer is intentionally slow.
- Expectation: producer experiences BLOCKED outcomes when edge is full; once consumer drains,
  producer resumes successfully. This validates cooperative backpressure semantics end-to-end.

Notes:
- We exercise the public API (Node, Subgraph, Scheduler) to validate wiring and policy selection.
- The Scheduler applies Block() for CONTROL messages in _handle_node_emit.

Timing:
- Keep sleeps very small and the scheduler timeout tight to ensure the test completes quickly.
- Deterministic stop: run scheduler in a background thread and explicitly request shutdown after a short window.
