"""Unit tests for scheduler priority fairness using PrioritySchedulingQueue.

Focus:
- CONTROL band preference over HIGH/NORMAL when available.
- Approximate proportional servicing across bands using fairness_ratio.
- FIFO (round-robin) behavior within a given band.
- Fallback selection when ratio logic yields no direct pick but queues exist.

Notes:
These tests operate directly on PrioritySchedulingQueue, not the full Scheduler loop,
to keep them deterministic and fast. We assert qualitative fairness properties based
on the simple ratio algorithm implemented today.
