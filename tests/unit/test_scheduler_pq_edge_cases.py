"""Unit tests for PrioritySchedulingQueue edge cases and starvation avoidance.

These tests exercise the queue directly (not the full Scheduler loop) to validate:
- FIFO within a band approximates round-robin when nodes are re-enqueued.
- Ratio-biased servicing across bands prefers CONTROL over HIGH over NORMAL.
- Re-enqueue deduplication: a node should not appear multiple times in a band queue.
- Starvation avoidance heuristics: when multiple bands are runnable, CONTROL dominates
  but lower bands still get serviced over time in the current implementation.

Grounding in source:
- PrioritySchedulingQueue.get_next_runnable() implements a simple fairness selection:
  prefers CONTROL, then HIGH, then NORMAL, with an approximate ratio check and
  a fallback that services any available band.
- enqueue_runnable() removes existing occurrences to avoid duplicates, then appends.

Note:
- This queue provides approximate fairness, not strict quotas. The assertions are
  qualitative and avoid overfitting to internal counters.
