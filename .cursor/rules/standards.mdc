Guiding Principles
- Composable first: graphs, subgraphs, and clear boundaries.
- Async-friendly: Python 3.11+, asyncio-native.
- Predictable execution: fairness, backpressure, bounded edges.
- Observability by default: structured logs, metrics, optional tracing.
- Safety and privacy: no payloads in errors by default, redaction hooks.
- Maintainability: small, testable modules (~200 LOC/file guidance).
- Platform-agnostic: no host-specific assumptions (e.g., not GitHub-only).
- Docs-as-product: plans, support docs, and examples are first-class.
